# CryptoClustering
 
 # Project Description

 In this challenge, we demonstrate our knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

 This challenge is completed in a Jupyter Notebook

# Sections in the Jupyter Notebook
1. Prepare the Data.
2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame.
3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data.
4. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis.
5. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data.
6. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data.
